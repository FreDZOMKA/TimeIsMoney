TIME IS MONEY - Money stopwatch and Income per second calculator

In this project the user inputs their income and selects a time unit, for example $16/hour or $32k/month.
The number and format is then taken and calculated into income per second. Using a stopwatch type clock the user can see their income per second.
The project uses a webpage built with HTML and CSS getting functionality from vanilla JavaScript.
This was an idea I came up with when I was a kid working minmium wage reminding myself that for every second of hard work I was getting paid.
